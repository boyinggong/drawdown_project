\section{Statistical summary}

\subsection{Annualized return}

Annualised return are calculated based on the daily returns. 
\begin{equation}
R_a = (1+R_d)^{N} -1
\end{equation}
where $R_a$ is the annualized returns, $R_d$ is the daily returns, N is the number of trading days in one year (N = 252).

\subsection{Sharpe Ratio, Standard deviation, Skewnes and Kurtosis}
Symbol explanation:

i: represents different index.

t: time period.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sharpe Ratio
\begin{equation}
sharpe\_ratio = \frac{\bar{r}_i-Rf}{\sigma_i}
\end{equation}
Here we let $Rf = 0$
\item Standard deviation
\begin{equation}
standard\_deviation_i =\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{t=1}^n{(r_i^t-\bar{r}_i)^2}} 
\end{equation}
\item Skewness
\begin{equation}
skewness_i = E_t \left[ \left( \frac{r_i^t-\bar{r}_i}{\sigma_i} \right)^3 \right]
\end{equation}
\item Kurtosis
\begin{equation}
kurtosis_i = \frac{E_t \left[ \left( r_i^t-\bar{r}_i \right)^4 \right]}{\left(E_t \left[ \left( r_i^t-\bar{r}_i \right)^2 \right]\right)^2}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}




\section{Risk diagnostics}

In this section, all the risk diagnostics are calculated based on daily returns.

\subsection{VaR \& ES}

\begin{itemize}
\item VaR

$\textit{Value at Risk (VaR)} $  is a measure of the risk of investments. It estimates how much a set of investments might lose, given normal market conditions, in a set time period such as a day. VaR is typically used by firms and regulators in the financial industry to gauge the amount of assets needed to cover possible losses. The mathematicial representation of VaR under $\alpha$ was shown below. \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value\_at\_risk}
\begin{equation}
VaR_{\alpha}(L) = inf\{l \in \mathbb{R} : P(L > l) \leq 1-\alpha \} = 
inf\{l \in \mathbb{R} : F_L(l) \geq \alpha \}
\end{equation}
\item ES

$\textit{Expected shortfall (ES)}$ is a risk measure -- a concept used in the field of financial risk measurement to evaluate the market risk or credit risk of a portfolio. The ``expected shortfall at q\% level" is the expected return on the portfolio in the worst q\% of cases. ES is an alternative to Value at Risk that is more sensitive to the shape of the loss distribution in the tail of the distribution. The mathematicial representation of ES was shown below.\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected\_shortfall}
\begin{equation}
ES_{\alpha}(L) = E\left[ L \vert L<VaR_{\alpha}(L) \right]
\end{equation}

\end{itemize}



\subsection{CED}

Maximum drawdown is the largest cumulative loss from peak to trough. Conditional Expected Drawdown (CED) is the tail mean of maximum drawdown distributions.\footnote{On a Convex Measure of Drawdown Risk. Lisa R. Goldberg, Ola Mahmoud} Under confidence level $\alpha$, the conditional expected drawdown is defined as:
\begin{equation}
CED_\alpha(X_{T_n}) = \textbf{E}(\mathbf{\mu}(X_{T_n})|\mathbf{\mu}(X_{T_n}) > DT_\alpha)
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{\mu}(X_{T_n})$ is the maximum drawdown distribution over a finite path.

We calculate the CED of various assets under 0.9, 0.95, 0.99 confidence level for different path length (3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years) separately. Note that for longer path length such as 2-year and 5-year, there might be some missing values under large confidence levels. CED data tend to be lack of variance under long time period. In such cases, the empirical quantile no longer exits without some distribution or polynomial assumption of the tail. Since we do not familiar the performance of CED, it becomes impropriate to make such assumptions.

\section{Time varying risk diagnostics}

We calculate the time varying variance(Figure \ref{fig: variance6mon}), VaR\ref{fig: VaR6mon} and ES\ref{fig: ES6mon}  for different assets over a 6-month and a 1-year rolling window (confidence level: 0.95) seperately, to see how these two risk diagnostics changing over time. 

\section{Basic Analyzing}
In the practice, investment managers tend to choose the assets with a higher sharpe ratio, as they can are expected to produce more return on unit risk(votility). However, according to the \ref{tab: statSum}, all the Sharpe Ratio is below 0.8. This makes sense, as all the indices in the list are either consist of one issue with low returns (eg: G0O1) or a portforlio of assets with varied risk and return, and thus no index give a spectacular performace. \\
Among all the indices, it is necessary to highlight G0O1 and RMZ. G0O1 is the 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index, which is considered to be free of risk. It yields a outstanding Sharpe Ratio while it does not actually have a  high return (\ref{fig: dailyReturns}). It blows up because its super stable return giving a smaller(close to 0) denominator. RMZ is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is comprised of equity REITs(Real Estate Investment Trusts), which is expected to have a high voltility, especially for subprime mortagae crisis around 2008 (It indeed is the case based on \ref{fig: dailyReturns}). In the table, it reveals in the table as a high standard deviation.\\
Statistics in \ref{tab: VaRES} also accord with information we get from \ref{tab: statSum}. Since there is almost no volatility in G0O1, its returns (and also lost) will center around zero, forming a peak in the \ref{fig: dreturnsDist}. From the definition of VaR and ES, they are thus very closed to zero, indicating a lower risk. Considering a high standard deviation, RMZ's return are spread out, resulting in a higher VaR and ES. Individual figures \ref{fig: variance6mon} \ref{fig: VaR6mon} \ref{fig: ES6mon} are also able to report two extreme risk conditions of G0O1 and RMZ.\\
For the CEDs in \ref{table:CED3}, there is a general trend that larger rolling time windows produce high tail mean of maximum drawdown, for the reason that it can incorporate more underlying risk in the each time period. The risk revelation of tail mean of maximum drawdown also agree with the fact and other measurement: G0O1 has smallest CED and RMZ has the highest.
